# Galectin-in-placenta-development-and-preeclampsia-
Single cell data analysis contributing in uncovering the critical role of maternal galectin-1 (gal-1) in mammalian reproduction and in the placental adaptations required for a successful pregnancy

The placenta is formed from the molecular dialogue with the maternal niche; failure in placentation increases the risk of developing preeclampsia (PE), a life-threatening disease associated with lifelong adverse health consequences for the mother and offspring. Mechanisms underlying the maternal contribution to the placentation process remain unclear. This work uncovered the critical role of maternal galectin-1 (gal-1) in mammalian reproduction. Using specific niche Lgals1 deficient models, we determined that maternal-derived gal-1 boosts the invasive trophoblast capacity by modulating differential Sda terminal N-glycosylation and HB-EGF bioavailability at the maternal-fetal interface. These observations provide a better understanding of the maternal molecular dialogue involved in the placental adaptations required for a successful pregnancy.
